# NTU-STARS-Planner
### This project was created for iNTUition Hackathon 2019 hosted at NTU, by IEEE.
### Aims to help students with course selection and planning. It takes the course indexes of the student as input and checks the lecture, tutorial and seminar timings of all courses to automatically create a customized timetable without any clash in class timings, so that students don't face the inconvenience of making it manually.
